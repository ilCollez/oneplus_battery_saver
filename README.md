# OnePlus Battery Saver


## Introduction
This app aims to improve OnePlus battery life by managing the refresh rate.<br />
In particular situations (Power saving mode, certain battery percentage reached), this app sets the screen frame rate to 60Hz <br />
And then bring it back to 90Hz when everything goes back to normal <br />
This is my first project in Android, and i would like to thank [Samuele794](https://it.linkedin.com/in/samuele794) for mentoring me during the development of this app.
